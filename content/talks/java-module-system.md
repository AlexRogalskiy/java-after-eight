Java 9 shipped the Java Platform Module System, which brings language-level modularity to the Java ecosystem.
But you already know that and even spent some time to learn the basics?
That's great because this talk takes you beyond that and shows how to...

* model finer-grained dependencies and APIs
* decouple modules with services
* weigh encapsulation versus reflection
* analyze dependencies with `jdeps`
* safe the day with important command line flags
* create runtime images with `jlink`

With this under your belt, you're ready to become your team's module system expert.
