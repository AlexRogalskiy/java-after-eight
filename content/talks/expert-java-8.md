By now Java 8's features are well understood, but some practical details are still unclear. Did you ever wonder...

* how to create a "lambda-enabled" API?
* whether your methods should return or even accept `Stream`s and how that might impact your design?
* how to write readable `Stream` pipelines, especially when exceptions are involved?
* about the details of and opinions on `Optional`?
* how to use default methods to evolve interfaces without breaking client code?

This talk discusses these and other advanced topics of Java 8, so you can get the most out of its awesome features.
